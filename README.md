## About The Project
This is a [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) Extension that helps witht he cluttered groups index on [Canvas](https://canvas.tue.nl/). While Courses have a inherent star function that allows you to hide unused courses, projects only have this function in the mobile app. The desktop site is still a complete mess with groups, that are used, taking up valiable space. This Extension hides the groups that you want to be hidden. With a simple menu, groups can be added to the *hide* list. It then automatically hides every group, of your chosing, when it gets loaded in by Canvas.

## Installation
